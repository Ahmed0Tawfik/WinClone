# WinClone

## What is WinClone?

WinClone is a Windows application backup and restore tool that helps you save your computer's setup and easily restore it later.

## What does it do?

**Backup (Scan)**: 
- Takes a "snapshot" of your Windows computer
- Records all your installed programs, settings, and configurations
- Creates a backup file that contains everything needed to restore your system

**Restore**: 
- Uses the backup file to reinstall all your programs
- Restores your settings and configurations
- Gets your computer back to exactly how it was when you created the backup

**List**: 
- Shows you what programs and settings are currently installed
- Helps you see what would be included in a backup

## Why use WinClone?

- **Moving to a new computer**: Transfer all your programs and settings to a new PC
- **System recovery**: Quickly restore your computer after a crash or reinstall
- **Backup before changes**: Save your current setup before making major changes
- **Share configurations**: Share your setup with others or across multiple computers

## Simple Example

1. Run WinClone to scan your current computer
2. Save the backup file somewhere safe
3. Later, use that backup file to restore everything on a new computer or after a fresh Windows install

Think of it like taking a photo of your computer's setup, then using that photo to rebuild everything exactly as it was.
